# bnssg-quarto

This repository provides a quarto template and a project structure to support BNSSG analytical teams to use R.

## Installation

Before proceeding, make sure your "Terminal" options are correctly set. To do this go to:

1. **Tools > Terminal > Terminal Options**
2. Select "New Terminals open with:" **Git Bash** (preferably), but if that isn't an option, select **Windows PowerShell**
3. Select **OK**
4. **Tools > Terminal > New Terminal**

The template can be installed using the following command in the Terminal tab in RStudio:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
quarto use template nhs-bnssg-analytics/bnssg-quarto
```

Alternatively, to copy everything into this working directory except the `template.qmd` Quarto document, use the following command in the Terminal tab in RStudio:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
quarto add nhs-bnssg-analytics/bnssg-quarto
```
